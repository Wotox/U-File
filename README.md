Ãœ-File

For Linux systems
Execute on Python 3 only

Now it can jump to directories, create and delete files.
I make moving files and dirs now.

U-File register root directory that place, where main.py file is located.
It would be good if it could execute from any place, without moving file from one directory to another, etc.
I'm working on it.
